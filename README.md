## Configuration Variables Explained

### Core Trading Settings

#### `INITIAL_BALANCE = 17500.0` (₹14.6L - ₹16.7L)
**What it does**: Starting account balance for trading
**Recommended**: $15,000-20,000 for optimal trading
**Impact**: Higher balance = better risk management, lower liquidation risk

#### `BALANCE_PER_TRADE_PCT = 0.15` (15% per trade)
**What it does**: Percentage of total balance used per trade in normal mode
**Why 15%**: Perfect balance between growth potential and safety
- **Too low (5%)**: Very slow growth but very safe
- **Too high (25%+)**: Fast growth but high risk of major losses
**Example**: With ₹10,000 balance → ₹1,500 per trade

#### `SAFE_BALANCE_PER_TRADE_PCT = 0.05` (5% per trade)
**What it does**: Automatically activates when balance ≤ ₹1,000
**Purpose**: Extra safety for small accounts
**Example**: With ₹100 balance → ₹5 per trade (very safe)

#### `DEFAULT_LEVERAGE = 30.0` (30x leverage)
**What it does**: Multiplies your position size by 30x
**Why 30x**: Optimized from 50x for better risk management
**Example**: ₹1,000 margin → ₹30,000 position exposure
**Risk**: Higher leverage = higher profits BUT higher liquidation risk

#### `MAX_POSITIONS_OPEN = 2`
**What it does**: Maximum number of positions you can have simultaneously
**Why 2**: Prevents overexposure, allows better focus per position
**Rule**: System rejects new trades if 2 positions already open

### Risk Management Thresholds

#### `HIGH_RISK_MARGIN_PCT = 85.0` (85% threshold)
**What it does**: When total margin usage reaches 85%, high risk alerts start
**Example**: With ₹10,000 balance, alert triggers at ₹8,500 margin usage

#### `MAX_PORTFOLIO_RISK_PCT = 80.0` (80% limit)
**What it does**: **ANTI-OVERTRADE PROTECTION** - NO new trades when exceeded
**Purpose**: Prevents you from risking too much money at once
**Example**: With ₹10,000 balance, no new trades when ₹8,000+ already at risk

### Emergency Close Settings (Last Resort Safety)

#### `EMERGENCY_CLOSE_MARGIN_PCT = 95.0` (95% margin usage)
**What it does**: Automatically closes positions when margin usage hits 95%
**Purpose**: Prevents liquidation (liquidation usually happens at 100%)
**Example**: Position closed before you lose everything

#### `EMERGENCY_CLOSE_LOSS_PCT = 15.0` (15% loss)
**What it does**: Automatically closes position when loss exceeds 15%
**Purpose**: Prevents catastrophic losses
**Example**: ₹1,000 position → closed if loss reaches ₹150

#### `EMERGENCY_CLOSE_TIME_HOURS = 48.0` (48 hours)
**What it does**: Automatically closes positions held longer than 48 hours
**Purpose**: Prevents stale positions that aren't performing
**Example**: BTC position opened Monday → auto-closed Wednesday if still open

### Risk Level Thresholds (Progressive Warning System)

#### CRITICAL RISK (90% margin, 12% loss, 36 hours)
**Action**: Position immediately closed
**Example**: BTC position with 12% loss → system closes it

#### HIGH RISK (80% margin, 8% loss, 24 hours)
**Action**: Tighten stop-loss, send warnings
**Example**: ETH position with 8% loss → stop-loss moved closer

#### MEDIUM RISK (70% margin, 5% loss, 12 hours)
**Action**: Monitor closely, consider taking profits
**Example**: Position with 5% loss → extra monitoring starts

### Fee Settings

#### `TRADING_FEE_PCT = 0.001` (0.1% fee)
**What it does**: Fee charged when opening position
**Calculation**: Fee = margin_used × 0.001
**Example**: ₹1,000 margin → ₹1 entry fee

#### `EXIT_FEE_MULTIPLIER = 0.5` (50% of entry fee)
**What it does**: Exit fee is half of entry fee
**Example**: ₹1 entry fee → ₹0.50 exit fee → ₹1.50 total fees

## How Trading System Works

### Step 1: Signal Generation
**When**: Every 10 minutes
**How**: EMA strategy analyzes BTCUSD and ETHUSD price data
**Conditions**: 
- Price crosses above EMA = BUY signal
- Price crosses below EMA = SELL signal
- Signal confidence must be ≥50%

### Step 2: Pre-Trade Validation
**System checks**:
1. Is signal confidence ≥50%? 
2. Is price data valid?
3. Do we already have a position for this symbol? (ONE POSITION PER SYMBOL RULE)
4. Have we exceeded daily trade limit (50 trades)?

### Step 3: Anti-Overtrade Check (NEW FEATURE)
**System calculates current portfolio risk**:
- Total margin usage across all positions
- If ≥80% of balance at risk → **TRADE BLOCKED**
- If ≥85% → Warning sent but trade may proceed

**Example**: 
```
Account: ₹10,000
Open positions using: ₹8,000 margin (80%)
New trade needs: ₹1,500 margin
Result: TRADE BLOCKED - "Portfolio risk too high"
```

### Step 4: Position Sizing Calculation
**Smart sizing based on balance**:

**For balance ≤₹1,000 (Safe Mode)**:
- Uses 5% per trade
- Lower leverage if needed
- Extra conservative settings

**For balance >₹1,000 (Normal Mode)**:
- Uses 15% per trade
- Full 30x leverage
- Standard risk settings

### Step 5: Trade Execution
**System creates position with**:
- Entry price from signal
- Calculated quantity 
- 30x leverage (or less if risky)
- Stop-loss at 5% below entry (LONG) or above entry (SHORT)
- Take-profit at 10% above entry (LONG) or below entry (SHORT)

### Step 6: Continuous Monitoring
**Every 1 minute system checks**:
- Current price vs stop-loss/take-profit
- Position risk level (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)
- Portfolio total risk
- Time position has been held

## Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Small Balance Safe Mode
```
Account Balance: ₹500
Signal: BUY BTCUSD at ₹42,00,000
Mode: SAFE MODE (balance ≤₹1,000)

Calculations:
1. Trade amount: ₹500 × 5% = ₹25
2. With 30x leverage: ₹25 × 30 = ₹750 position
3. Quantity: ₹750 ÷ ₹42,00,000 = 0.0000178 BTC
4. Margin used: ₹25
5. Trading fee: ₹25 × 0.1% = ₹0.025
6. Total cost: ₹25.025

Position Details:
- Stop-loss: ₹39,90,000 (5% below entry)
- Take-profit: ₹46,20,000 (10% above entry)
- Risk: Very low due to safe mode
```

### Example 2: Normal Balance Normal Mode
```
Account Balance: ₹10,000
Signal: BUY BTCUSD at ₹42,00,000
Mode: NORMAL MODE

Calculations:
1. Trade amount: ₹10,000 × 15% = ₹1,500
2. With 30x leverage: ₹1,500 × 30 = ₹45,000 position
3. Quantity: ₹45,000 ÷ ₹42,00,000 = 0.00107 BTC
4. Margin used: ₹1,500
5. Trading fee: ₹1,500 × 0.1% = ₹1.5
6. Total cost: ₹1,501.5

Position Details:
- Stop-loss: ₹39,90,000 (5% below entry)
- Take-profit: ₹46,20,000 (10% above entry)
- Remaining balance: ₹8,498.5
```

### Example 3: Anti-Overtrade Protection
```
Account Balance: ₹10,000
Current positions: 2 positions using ₹7,500 margin
New signal: BUY ETHUSD (would need ₹1,500 margin)
Portfolio risk: (₹7,500 + ₹1,500) ÷ ₹10,000 = 90%

Result: TRADE BLOCKED
Message: "🚫 ANTI-OVERTRADE: Portfolio risk too high 90% >= 80%"
Action: Must close existing positions first
```

### Example 4: Profit Calculation
```
Entry: BUY BTCUSD at ₹42,00,000
Exit: Sell at ₹46,20,000 (10% profit)
Position: 0.00107 BTC (₹45,000 exposure)
Leverage: 30x

Profit Calculation:
1. Price change: ₹46,20,000 - ₹42,00,000 = ₹4,20,000
2. Percentage change: 10%
3. Position profit: ₹45,000 × 10% = ₹4,500
4. Fees paid: ₹1.5 (entry) + ₹0.75 (exit) = ₹2.25
5. Net profit: ₹4,500 - ₹2.25 = ₹4,497.75
6. ROI on margin: ₹4,497.75 ÷ ₹1,500 = 299.85%
7. New balance: ₹10,000 + ₹4,497.75 = ₹14,497.75
```

## Risk Management System

### 4-Tier Risk Classification

#### 🟢 LOW RISK
**Conditions**: 
- Margin usage <70%
- Loss <5%
- Position age <12 hours
**Action**: Normal monitoring only
**Email**: No alerts sent

#### 🟡 MEDIUM RISK  
**Conditions**:
- Margin usage 70-85%
- Loss 5-8%
- Position age 12-24 hours
**Action**: Increased monitoring, consider taking profits
**Email**: Risk level change notification

#### 🟠 HIGH RISK
**Conditions**:
- Margin usage 85-90%
- Loss 8-12%  
- Position age 24-36 hours
**Action**: Tighten stop-losses, prepare for exit
**Email**: High risk warning with recommendations

#### 🔴 CRITICAL RISK
**Conditions**:
- Margin usage 90-95%
- Loss 12-15%
- Position age 36-48 hours
**Action**: Immediate position closure

### Portfolio-Level Protection

#### Anti-Overtrade System
**Purpose**: Prevents taking too much risk across all positions
**How it works**:
1. Calculates total margin usage across all open positions
2. If ≥80% of balance at risk → blocks new trades
3. If ≥85% → sends high risk warnings
4. Provides clear feedback: "Portfolio risk too high, close positions first"

#### Position Limits
- **Maximum positions**: 2 simultaneously
- **One per symbol**: Cannot have 2 BTC positions
- **Balance-based sizing**: Smaller accounts get extra protection

### Smart Recommendations

Based on current portfolio state, system provides actionable advice:

**Low Risk**: "💡 Low margin usage - Opportunity for more positions"
**Medium Risk**: "📊 Monitor closely - Consider taking profits"  
**High Risk**: "⚠️ Reduce exposure - Tighten stop losses"
**Critical Risk**: "🚨 Immediate action required - Close positions"
**Anti-Overtrade**: "🚫 New trades blocked - Close existing positions first"
